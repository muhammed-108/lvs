Step 1 Configure Nginx1 and Nginx2.
Set the gateway of Nginx1 and Nginx2 to the LVS DIP according to the preceding
figure. Command example:
nmcli con mod ens224 ipv4.address 10.0.0.2/24 ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.10
nmcli con down ens224 & nmcli con up ens224


Step 2 Preconfigure the LVS.
Configure two NICs for the LVS ECS, one for the VIP and the other for the DIP. The DIP is
an intranet IP address and does not need a gateway. The VIP is a public IP address and
needs to be configured with gateway information. In addition, to ensure normal IP
forwarding, disable the Source/Destination Check item, as shown in the following
figure.
Enable the IP forwarding function on the LVS ECS.
[root@Cluster1 ~]# sed -i "s/ip_forward=0/ip_forward=1/g" /etc/sysctl.conf
[root@Cluster1 ~]# sysctl -p | grep net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
[root@Cluster1 ~]# sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1


Step 3 Install and configure the LVS.
On the LVS, run the following command to install ipvsadm:
[root@Cluster1 ~]# yum install -y ipvsadm
After the installation is complete, create a configuration file required for starting
ipvsadm.
[root@Cluster1 ~]# touch /etc/sysconfig/ipvsadm
If the service is started properly, run the following command to create a cluster using the
round robin algorithm:
[root@Cluster1 ~]# ipvsadm -A -t 192.168.1.10:80 -s rr
Add Nginx1 and Nginx2 as backend real servers, or RSs.
[root@Cluster1 ~]# ipvsadm -a -t 192.168.1.10:80 -r 10.0.0.2 -m
[root@Cluster1 ~]# ipvsadm -a -t 192.168.1.10:80 -r 10.0.0.3 -m
Check whether the configuration takes effect.
[root@Cluster1 ~]# ipvsadm -Ln
IP Virtual Server version 1.2.1 (size=4096)
Prot LocalAddress:Port Scheduler Flags
 -> RemoteAddress:Port Forward Weight ActiveConn InActConn
TCP 192.168.1.10:80 rr
 -> 10.0.0.2:80 Masq 1 0 0
 -> 10.0.0.3:80 Masq 1 0 0

Step 4 Check the LVS configuration.
On the ECS where the LVS resides, use the LVS VIP to repeatedly access the web service.
The following information is displayed:


Step 1 Modify the LVS configuration.
Run the following command to change the LVS algorithm to weighted round robin:
[root@Cluster1 ~]# ipvsadm -E -t 192.168.1.10:80 -s wrr


Step 2 Change the weights of the two RSs.
Change the weight of Nginx1 to 2.
[root@Cluster1 ~]# ipvsadm -e -t 192.168.1.10:80 -r 10.0.0.2 -m -w 2
Step 3 Check the LVS configuration.
Log in to the client ECS, use the LVS VIP to repeatedly access the web service. The
following information is displayed:
curl ipofcluster
