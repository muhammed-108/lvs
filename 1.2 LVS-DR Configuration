Step 1 Configure Nginx1 and Nginx2.
The configuration method is the same as that in the previous lab.
Additionally, perform network configuration on the two NGINX nodes.
Run the following command to add VIP configurations:
nmcli connection add type dummy ifname dummy2 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.100/32
Run the following commands to change the RIP gateway address to the router interface
address:
nmcli connection modify ens224 ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.1
nmcli connection down ens224
nmcli connection up ens224
After the network configuration is complete, modify the ARP kernel parameters.
cat >> /etc/sysctl.conf << EOF
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_announce = 2
net.ipv4.conf.dummy2.arp_ignore = 1
net.ipv4.conf.dummy2.arp_announce = 2
EOF



Step 2 Preconfigure the LVS.
If the LVS in the previous lab is reused in this lab, remove the existing configurations.
Run the following command to delete the LVS configuration added in the preceding lab:
ipvsadm -D -t 192.168.1.10:80
After the deletion, run the following command to add VIP configurations:
nmcli connection add type dummy ifname dummy2 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.100/32
Run the following commands to set the DIP gateway address to the router interface
address:
nmcli connection modify ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.1
nmcli connection down ens224
nmcli connection up ens224
If the LVS is newly created, you only need to add the VIP configurations and change the
gateway address.

Step 3 Configure the LVS.
If the LVS is newly created, install ipvsadm based on Step 3 in 1.1.3.
Run the following commands to add required configurations:
ipvsadm -A -t 10.0.0.100:80 -s rr
ipvsadm -a -t 10.0.0.100:80 -r 10.0.0.3
ipvsadm -a -t 10.0.0.100:80 -r 10.0.0.2
Verify the configuration. Information in the following figure is displayed:
ipvsadm -Ln


Step 4 Check the LVS configuration.
Log in to the client ECS, use the LVS VIP to repeatedly access the web service. The
following information is displayed:
It shows that the LVS forwards the requests to Nginx1 and Nginx2 in round robin mode
and returns the page to the client.
